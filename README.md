# VEH-Hook
Vectored Exception Handling Hooking Class

How to use:

1) #include "LeoSpecial"
2) instantiation a LeoHook Class
3) Calls LeoHook's Hook() function, passing in a pointer to the original function as first argument and pointer to hook function to as second parameter.
4) ???
5) Profit
6) Call Unhook() to remove the hook.

I did not build a system with multiple hooks in it, so if there is a need to hook multiple functions, construct multiple LeoHook's class.

Enjoy!
